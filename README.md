Star Wars RPG

This is a simple Star Wars "RPG" game that uses JQuery for DOM manipulation. The main objective is to select a character and defeat all enemies.

To begin, select a character. Once you select a character, you will then select another character to attack - this will be the "defender". At this point, you can press the attack button.

Press the attack button to attack. You will damage the defender by an amount equal to your character's attack power. If the defender survives the attack, then they will attack you back for an amount equal to their base attack power. Once you defeat an enemy, your attack power will increase by your base power amount. At this point, you will select the next defender to attack.

You win the game by defeating all the remaining characters. If your character's health reaches 0, then you lose and the game will reset.

Have fun!
